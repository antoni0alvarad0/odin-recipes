    <h2>Amazing air fried pork chops</h2>
    <p>This recipe I usually make on a cast iron pan, I decided to try to see if I could replicate it in the Air Fryer.</p>

    <p>Know to be fair you will not get that crispy fat that you get from a cast iron pan but if you are looking for less grease and exact flavor. Go for it! The flavor comes out perfect and the chops and to my surprise the chops were very moist.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients For Rub</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>sazon</li>
        <li>Adobo</li>
        <li>Complete Mix</li>
        <li>Avocado Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take all dry ingredients and place them in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix all dry ingredients well.</li>
        <li>Rub the pork chops lightly with Avocado oil.</li>
        <li>Then take the dry rub and cover chops thoroughly with the rub.</li>
        <li>At this point let the rub set, while doing so preheat your air fryer.</li>
        <li>After the frier is preheated place the chops in the air frier standing up fat down.</li>
        <li>Place chops in and air fry at 390 for 18 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
