    <h2>Amazing air fried pork chops</h2>
    <p>This recipe I usually make on a cast iron pan, I decided to try to see if I could replicate it in the Air Fryer.</p>

    <p>Know to be fair you will not get that crispy fat that you get from a cast iron pan but if you are looking for less grease and exact flavor. Go for it! The flavor comes out perfect and the chops and to my surprise the chops were very moist.</p>
