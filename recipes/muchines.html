    <h2>The perfect morning or afternoon coffee companion</h2>
    <p>Muchines are a food that is mostly eaten in Ecuador in the mornings due to its high carbs content it holds workers through the morning into the afternoon.</p>
    <p>This recipe was left to me by my grandmother she use to make them in the morning and just sometimes she would make them later on in the evening as a little snack just for us it was great.</p>
