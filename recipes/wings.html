    <h2>Great any time put <strong>BEST</strong> during a game</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe that came together during a late night poker game, it was late and there was not many things open to order from. So we had a bag of chicken wings, straight to defrost</p>

    <p>I took out some asian ingredients that I had in the fridge and put together a sauce that would compliment the wings in an asian infusion way. I will say for something that what so fast it worked out really well taste was on point.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds of wings</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Housin sauce</li>
        <li>Korean paste</li>
        <li>Scallions</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place all wet ingredients in a bowl and combine them and set aside. Cut up all scallions into thin rings also place to the side for garnish later.</li>
        <li>Dry wings, salt and pepper them in order to air fry them at 390 degrees for 22 minutes.</li>
        <li>While wings are cooking take wet ingredients and place them in a sauce pan, with stove top set to low simmer the sauce till thick and sticky.</li>
        <li>Once wings are done and to your desired crispiness, toss the wings in a large bowl with sauce and cover completely.</li>
        <li>Finally sprinkle the scallions on top as desired and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
